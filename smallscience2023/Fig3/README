The input/output and Matlab file used to get figure 3.
"in.fix" and "in.unfix" are basic input files for lodestar to calculate the transient current of the fixed graphene and the free-standing graphene, respectively.
Use "site.sh" to calculate the transient current of different irradiation sites.
Files in "siesta" folder are used to get figure 3d.
And plot the current map use "fig3.m"
